# hivetodo

A new Flutter project.

The to-do app using Hive in Flutter is a task management application that helps users stay organized and keep track of their daily tasks. It leverages Hive, a lightweight and fast NoSQL database solution for Flutter, to provide efficient local data storage.

With this app, users can create a list of tasks they need to complete, add details such as task title, description, and due date. They can mark tasks as complete, edit task details, and delete tasks as needed. Hive ensures that the task data is securely stored on the user's device, persisting even when the app is closed or the device is restarted.
